      <description>Multihead A few days ago, I relocated myself to new room. Actually this room I use for summer as its way cooler than others. I have a wall-mounted LCD monitor here so today I thought I should share how I do multi screening.
Hardware I have this lenovo X series machine which is my main machine I use. Its resolution is 1920x1080.
The second one is a LCD monitor. And the resolution is 1280x1024.</description>

      <description>BSPWM BSPWM is a tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of a full binary tree. It has support for EWMH and multihead.
Installation bspwm is available in almost all major distributions. If you can&amp;rsquo;t find it in your OS, clone the repository and build it.
Configuration bspwm uses sxhkd for keyboard shortcuts. It has no other way to handle with keyboard input and instead provides bspc program as its interface.</description>
